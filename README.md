# 🌊 Water Quality Analysis in South Indian States

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of water quality indicators — primarily **Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)** and **Dissolved Oxygen (DO)** — across five South Indian states: Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Pondicherry, and Tamil Nadu. The aim is to identify environmental trends, pollution levels, and regional discrepancies in water quality.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Compute and compare **average BOD and DO levels** by location
- Visualize the **distribution of water bodies** (rivers and lakes) across the regions
- Identify potential **outliers or pollution concerns**
- Apply basic **statistical methods** for insight extraction

## 📊 Visualizations
- Bar charts for average BOD and DO levels per state
- Pie chart showing distribution of water bodies
- Custom insights derived from statistical analysis

## 📈 Insights
- **Andhra Pradesh** shows a significant spike in BOD levels, indicating potential water pollution.
- **Pondicherry** leads in DO levels, suggesting cleaner or healthier water sources.
- Andhra Pradesh also has the largest share of water bodies (38.6%), making its BOD levels particularly concerning.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**, **Jupyter Notebook**
- Libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `numpy`
- Data Formats: CSV


## ✅ Skills Demonstrated
- Data Cleaning & Transformation (pandas)
- Statistical Summary & Insights (mean, median, outliers)
- Data Visualization (matplotlib/seaborn)
- Environmental understanding via BOD/DO metrics

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Build an anomaly detection model to flag highly polluted regions
- Automate weekly reports on water health by state
- Add interactive dashboards using Plotly or Streamlit
